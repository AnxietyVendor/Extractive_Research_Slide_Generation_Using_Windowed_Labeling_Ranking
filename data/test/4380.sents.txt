In this subsection, we focus on how TLSA records and the corresponding public keys are managed; more specically, we investigate if the TLSA records are used as intended and how often public and private key pairs are changed.
In this subsection, we focus on how TLSA records and the corresponding public keys are managed; more specically, we investigate how often public and private key pairs are changed.In subsection 5.5 TLSA Management, the authors would like to correct the following text:In subsection 5.5 TLSA Management, the authors would like to remove the following text from the paper: The primary purpose of DANE is to let domain owners use custom certificates for their TLS connections by using TLSA records with the DANE-EE or DANE-TA usage without relying on third-party CAs.
If the domain owner has a certificate issued by a CA, but serves a TLSA record with the DANE-EE or DANE-TA usage, they do not benefit fully from the security measures that DANE provides (instead, they should use the PKIX-EE or PKIX-TA Certificate Usage).
Moreover, the validity periods of such certificates are usually determined by CAs, which are usually short.
9 Thus, domain owners incur additional complexity as they need to update their TLSA records whenever the certificates are re-issued.
Therefore, a domain name owner should avoid setting their TLSA records with the DANE-EE or DANE-TA usage when they serve a certificate issued by a CA.We first examine how the Certificate Usage eld is set in TLSA records by calculating the distribution of the Certificate Usages of the TLSA records from our latest snapshot.
Unsurprisingly, we observe that the vast majority of TLSA records (94.29%) use DANE-EE or DANE-TA.
We then congure OpenSSL [61] to trust the set of root CA certificates in the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS root store [24]; the validation would fail if the certificates for the TLSA records are custom certificates.
Surprisingly, we nd that on average 90.58% and 90.37% of TLSA records with DANE-EE and DANE-TA are still valid, which means that the certificates are valid in terms of PKIX, not custom certificates.
Consequently, these records could :Corrected text:have used PKIX-EE or PKIX-TA Certificate Usages, thus having the additional benet of certificate validation through two independent mechanisms (DANE and PKIX).
We believe operators do this because they are worried that sending SMTP servers would reject their custom certificates.
However, as we will see in the next section, all of the popular email service providers (i.e., sending SMTP servers) that we test do not validate the certificates of the receiving SMTP servers when they cannot find any available TLSA records.
