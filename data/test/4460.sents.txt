Mobile ads pose privacy and security risks to consumers, including behavior tracking, malware, and inappropriate or biased content.
Advertising networks connect mobile app developers with advertisers, enabling in-app advertising.
We conducted a mixed-methods study with mobile app developers , consisting of survey and semi-structured interviews, to better understand why and how they partner with advertising networks, and their considerations of consumer risks in those interactions.
Our findings focus on app developers who work independently or in smaller companies.
We find that developers use advertising because they see it as the only viable way to monetize their app.
Developers mostly choose an advertising network based on perceptions of which ad networks are popular rather than a holistic assessment.
Despite claims of optimizing for profitability or consumer well-being, developers largely keep ad networks' default configurations.
Developers are resigned to ad-related consumer risks, seeing themselves as unable to and not responsible for addressing the risks.
Based on our findings, we discuss recommendations for mitigating consumer risks of mobile advertising.
Advertising accounts for over half of mobile app revenue [43].
An advertising network connects publishers (i.e., app developers) and advertisers [50,69].
Publishers offer ad networks space in their apps for advertising, e.g., a banner ad.
The ad network pays the publisher a fee for this space, e.g., X dollars for every Y users who click an ad.
The ad network then charges advertisers a slightly higher fee [50,69].
The most commonly adopted ad network is Google AdMob [74], used by over 90% of apps that show ads [67].
Other popular ad networks include Facebook Audiences (9.86%), StartApp (8.82%), and Unity Ads (7.32%) [67].
Ad networks often engage in targeted advertising [65], i.e., individual users are shown ads that are presumably relevant to their interests, e.g., someone who likes soccer might be shown an ad for tickets to a soccer match nearby [80].
The expectation is that since users are shown ads relevant to them, they are more likely to engage with the ad and buy the advertised product.
Advertisers can select what groups of people should see their ads based on interest-profile selectors.
This increases advertisers' revenue, and reduces resources spent on inefficient ads shown to consumers who are unlikely to engage with them [10].
Targeted advertising can benefit publishers as well: having ads that users are more likely to click increases the ad click rate and thus revenue [10].
Arguably, targeted advertising also benefits consumers, since consumers are not subjected to irrelevant ads [52].
However, targeted advertising also presents substantial risks for consumers.
A necessity of ad targeting is the extensive gathering of information about individual consumers.
This might include a consumer's online and app activities, age, gender, occupation, location, and other information inferred from individual behavior.
This data is used to create a profile for a given individual.
Ad networks infer what profiles are amenable to what sort of advertisements by monitoring who opens what kind of ads [52].
Information for ad targeting is often collected directly by ads displayed in an app and tracking code.
For instance, when a user opens an app with an ad, the ad network code used to load the ad can (potentially) access the location information of the device, and so determine where the user is.
The ad network can leverage this information to update the user's advertising profile and show the user more relevant ads (e.g., only showing ads for events near the user).
To better understand how developers interact with ad networks, we analyzed the websites, terms of use, and documentation of five prominent ad networks [24]: Google AdMob, One by AOL, InMobi, Smaato, and StartApp.
Overall we find that their services, functionalities, and even interfaces are very similar, with some minor differences.To use an ad network to host ads in their app, developers apply for an account, and after review their account is approved or rejected.
Once approved, developers have access to an online dashboard.
Although dashboards differ among ad networks, they typically allow developers to view their revenue earned and the apps they have registered with the ad network.
After registering an app, developers get access to the necessary code and IDs to integrate ads into their app.
Integrating the ad code is fairly straightforward.
Ad networks provide software development kits (SDKs) with which developers place ad display code in their app.
The SDK typically allows developers to configure the type of ad to display (e.g., banner ad, video ad, etc.), its size, and where/when it appears in the app.
Thus, while the ad network determines what ads get shown, the developer determines how ads are displayed.Through the online dashboard, developers can further filter what ad categories may appear in their apps.
Potential categories may include dating, cars, health, etc., and may differ by ad networks.
By default, almost all categories are enabled.
Google AdMob, though, has 'restricted ads' (for alcohol and gambling) that require publishers to opt-in to show them.
Others (e.g., InMobi) have these same categories enabled by default.
Developers can further block specific advertisers.In addition, developers can choose (to some degree) what user data the ad network collects through a specific app by requesting certain mobile permissions for the app.
Some permissions are required by the ad network (e.g., Internet connection, operating system, device type, network status); other permissions are not (e.g., precise geolocation).
Developers can choose whether to provide this information to the ad net-work.
Other information developers can choose to send to the ad network include a user's age and gender, depending on what ad display code is used in the app.
Developers have a financial incentive to share more information with ad networks: the more information is shared, the more relevant ads are delivered to users, and so, in theory, the developer's revenue will be greater.
Lastly, targeted ads (as opposed to non-targeted ads) are the default option for all five ad networks studied, but developers can choose to display non-targeted ads.
Prior research relevant to our work has focused on ad networks and developer behaviors regarding information seeking, tool selection, and privacy and security.
Documented consumer risks posed by ad networks include (1) insensitive or offensive content [3]; (2) discriminating ads (e.g., ads for high paying jobs only shown to men, or ads that associate "black-identifying names" with criminal sentences and offer felony checks for individuals [20,68]); (3) targeting based on sensitive content (e.g., religion) despite regulation against it [12]; and (4) excessive resource draining (such as battery and data) by ads [36,57,74].
Two prominent concerns are users' privacy and security.Regarding users' privacy, ad networks collect information about users to target ads.
This raises concerns over the vast quantities of information being collected, who has access to it, and for what purposes it is being used beyond advertising.
Studies have found that ad networks collect extensive personal information, over-privilege apps to collect more information than needed, and that current protections are not effective at safeguarding user privacy [34,46,58].
A user's profile and data could be exposed, not only to an ad network and its advertisers, but to anyone who could access the ads seen by the user [14,71].
Proposed solutions aim to protect consumer privacy while providing benefits of targeted ads [35,38,70], e.g., by performing targeting locally in the user's browser [70].
However, it is unclear how widely such solutions have been adopted.Regarding users' security, a prominent risk is that of fraudulent ads that redirect users towards installing malware [27,66], also known as madware [73].
Despite proposed solutions, such as improving malware classifiers using semantic features [15], it is still a prevalent problem.
In 2017, Google AdMob purged over a billion ads, due to malware, phishing, and other consumer risks [63].
Additionally, there is the risk of sensitive ads being shown to users that can cause emotional discomfort or harm [65].
To understand how app developers choose and engage with ad networks, it is important to know their information seeking behaviors.
Social environment, especially information from colleagues and close friends, is highly influential in determining what tools developers adopt [39,60,79].
For instance, the adoption of security tools is heavily shaped by whether peers are utilizing that tool [56,59,78].
However, while peers are an important and useful resource for adopting new tools, they get used infrequently [55,56].
Developers also use online forums and communities to find information and evaluate issues or complicated topics, such as code-related ethics, privacy risks, or the appropriateness of code contributions to a project [64,72].
Trust and ease of access are major factors in determining what information sources developers use [39].
Contextual factors, such as familiarity with subject matter, stage of project, and client characteristics further impact information seeking behavior [28].
A common theme in studies of app developers' privacy and security behaviors is that developers often want to adhere to 'good' privacy and security practices (e.g., create secure code, respect user privacy), but fail to do so for a variety of reasons, such as lack of resources or expertise [5,8,32], faulty information sources [1], or insufficient documentation [26].
Balebako et al. found that app developers struggled to navigate complex privacy policies of third-party libraries, and were generally unaware of the data collected by such tools [8].
Egele et al. found that app developers often make mistakes when using cryptographic APIs [23].
Some app developers ask for more permissions than necessary, potentially for financial incentives [26,46,58].
However, Gorski et al. showed that API-integrated security advice can support developers in improving code security [32].
Despite the recognized privacy and security risks, very few studies have looked specifically at how developers choose ad networks.
Some studies touch tangentially on this subject (e.g., Balebako et al. [8]) as part of more general investigations into developers' selection and use of tools.
In contrast, our study provides deeper insights into both how and why app developers interact with ad networks, as well as to what extent and how they consider consumer risks in those interactions.
To study mobile developers' behavior, practices, and attitudes regarding ad networks, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving a survey and semi-structured interviews.
Our study was approved by the University of Michigan's IRB.
We first conducted an online survey to understand developers' attitudes and behaviors regarding ad networks (see Appendix Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security 227 A).
We asked about participants' experience developing apps and working with advertising networks.
To gain more insights about particular experiences, we next asked participants to focus on one app for which they were involved in choosing and/or integrating ad network code.
We asked what resources were used to choose an ad network, and had them rate which factors they valued when choosing an ad network.
The survey concluded with demographic questions.
The survey was hosted on Qualtrics.
Participants were given the option to enter a raffle for eight $20 Amazon gift cards.
The median response time was 12.5 minutes.
We conducted semi-structured interviews with some survey participants to gain deeper insights into mobile developers' views, behaviors, and attitudes towards ad networks (see Appendix B).
We first asked participants about their background and experience with developing apps.
Second, we asked which ad networks they had used and their respective experiences.
Third, we asked how an ad network was chosen and how ads were configured in their app.
Fourth, we asked about issues, problems, and consumer risks they had seen, heard of, or experienced with ad networks.
Lastly, we asked broader questions to elicit their general thoughts regarding ad networks.
Interview participants received a $15 Amazon Gift Card.
Interviews lasted 27 to 42 minutes (median: 32 min.)
.
Interviews were transcribed and then analyzed with descriptive coding [53].
Two of the authors developed an initial codebook by jointly reading the transcripts and identifying emergent themes.
They then iteratively refined the codebook by separately coding an interview, determining inter-rater reliability, revising the codebook as needed, and repeating with a separate interview.
This procedure was repeated for 5 interviews until high inter-rater reliability was reached (Cohen's κ=.75) [53].
One of the authors then re-coded all interviews with the final codebook.
Our target population was app developers who have used ad networks in some capacity.
Thus, our recruitment message asked for participants who had worked with ad networks, but did not mention privacy, security or risks.We leveraged multiple channels to recruit participants, including posting in online forums aimed at app developers (e.g., the subreddit /r/AndroidDev) and technical Facebook groups; advertising through Craigslist; handing out flyers at local app developer meetups; reaching developers through personal contacts; and directly contacting developers based on contact information in the app store and LinkedIn.The recruitment message advertised both the survey and interview component of the study, encouraging (but not requiring) participation in both.
We conducted the survey and interviews in Summer and Fall 2018.
Our results show four key findings: (1) developers use advertising due to a belief that it is the only viable way to monetize an app; (2) when choosing an ad network, developers rely on online forums and ad networks' official websites, and do not spend much effort exploring which ad network to use; (3) developers often stick to ad networks' default configurations instead of optimizing for revenue or consumer safety; (4) developers do not view themselves as being able to or responsible for addressing consumer risks, believing that the responsibility lies with ad networks.
We first discuss participant demographics, before presenting our findings in detail.
We group findings by theme, combining findings from the survey and interviews, given that they address similar topics and complement each other nicely (quantitative information from the survey and rich qualitative insights from the interviews).
In total, 49 participants completed our survey.
Their median age was 24 years (range: 18-47 years), which is relatively young compared to app developers' estimated average age (34 years) [45].
37 participants were male, 3 female, 1 identified as non-binary, and the rest did not disclose their gender.
This is reflective of the male-dominated app development field, e.g., over 90% of UK app developers are male [75].
Mobile app development experience varied: 8 participants had less than one year, 12 had 1-2 years, 9 had 2-3 years, 10 had 3-4 years, and 10 had more than 4 years of experience developing mobile apps.
The median numbers of apps participants had worked on over the past three years was 6 (range: 1 to 100).
Most (38) developed Android apps, 23 for iOS, and 13 for both; 1 developed for Windows Phone.All participants provided the app's name and/or a link to its app store page.
We analyzed each app's download and review numbers.
As of May 2019, 26 apps were available in the Google Play store, with download numbers ranging from 10+ to 10, 000, 000+ (median: 10, 000+), and review numbers ranging from 1 to >504k (median: 157).
12 apps were not available in the Google Play Store, but via APKPure, an alternative Android app market.
9 apps were in the iOS App Store, which only provides review numbers (range: 6-519k, median: 118).
This snapshot shows that most participants' apps had a smaller audience, but other apps were highly popular.About half of our participants (26) worked in small companies (four employees or less), and most (38) worked in small development teams (see Figure 1).
This might be due to our recruitment strategies (e.g., directly contacting app developers via app store contact information), which were more likely to reach developers in small companies.
However, it is reasonable to expect that developers in small companies/teams have Table 1: Interview participant demographics (n=10).
more say in how ad networks are chosen and used.
Most (44) participants had worked as developers or software engineers; 23 as project managers; 16 as testers; 15 in upper management; 12 in marketing and 12 in user support (participants could select multiple roles).
9 survey participants were also interviewed.
An additional interview participant (P9) did not fill out the survey, but contacted the researchers to participate in the interview directly.
Table 1 provides their demographics.
All interviewees were male; their median age was 24 years (range: 19-39 years).
8 participants were app developers working alone or in small teams (< 5 employees); P3 worked for a slightly larger company and P6 worked in upper management of a larger company that develops several apps.
Most participants used ads out of a resignation that ads are the only way to make money (despite general dissatisfaction with ad revenue), and after a careful evaluation of the type of app being developed.
We first characterize ad network use before discussing why developers decided to use ads.
Ad networks were commonly used in the mobile apps developed by both survey and interview participants.
60% of the mobile apps developed by survey participants in the past three years used an ad network.
20 survey participants reported that advertising was the only monetization model they used.
The most used ad network was Google AdMob (91% used it at least once), followed by Unity Ads (34%), inMobi (22%), and StartApp (20%).
Others included Flurry (16%), Smaato (12%), One by AOL (12%), and LeadBolt (8%).
This reflects a market dominated by Google AdMob, echoing prior work [74].
16 survey participants and 6 interviewees had worked with three or more ad networks.
When asked why advertising was chosen, 7 interview participants expressed a resignation towards advertising, saying it was the only viable way to monetize an app.
They noted that because most apps are free (and monetized through ads), the only realistic way for an app to be competitive is to make it free as well.
P10 said: "I [knew] that many people wouldn't consider purchasing my app, so the only other viable option at the point seemed to include ads."
P9 was explicit: "If it wasn't for advertising, almost all the independent developers would basically just die."
P6 mentioned a 'race to the bottom': when apps first came out they were expensive, but over time, app developers competed with one another, driving prices down and eventually forcing many apps to be free.Despite a resignation towards ads, both survey and interview participants expressed dissatisfaction with ad revenue.
In the survey, we asked participants whether and why they had changed ad networks in the past.
All 10 survey participants who had changed ad networks indicated that higher revenue was a very/extremely important factor for changing -suggesting that their current revenue levels might be low or at least could be improved from their perspective.
Moreover, 8 interview participants directly complained about the low revenue share they receive from ad networks.
P7 stated: "Google [AdMob] takes quite a big cuts of ad revenue obviously themselves, so you as the developer don't always see a lot of returns."
P2 similarly said: "It's tough because the advertising dollars are so low, you need to have a large-scale viewership.
You can't just have 1,000 people playing and watching."
While also disappointed with ad revenue, P10 had a different motivation for using ads: annoy users and encourage them to pay for the app's ad-free premium version.
Alongside resignation with ads, all interview participants considered the type of app they were developing in their monetization choice.
They would consider the app's genre, expected audience, and how often people would use the app and for Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security 229 how long.
Interviewees noted that for an app targeted toward a niche market, an app developer could charge users while still profit and gain traction.
However, for a 'general' app with a wider audience, or an app that people would use infrequently, advertising was considered the only option for monetization.
3 interviewees considered ads ultimately a fair way to monetize apps for both users and developers: for users, viewing ads may be annoying and inconvenient, but less so than paying for an app.
P7, who used advertising in their app, said this is because the app offered a "pretty basic service [which isn't] worth that much necessarily," and considered it unfair to charge users for it.
Similarly, on comparing ads to charging for in-app purchases, P2 said "I felt better about asking people to watch an ad rather than pay for a feature."
Another perspective emerging from the interviews is that ads were a fair compensation for the free app users were getting: if the app developer had spent significant time and energy creating an app, it was fair that users 'pay' the cost of seeing ads to compensate the developer.
Furthermore, 4 interviewees considered ads to have low impact on the user experience (less so than charging money).
P1 justified his use of ads because "[users] could always just shut off the ads and get rid of them," i.e., noting that it is up to the user whether they see ads or pay for the premium version.
We asked both survey and interview participants how they selected the specific ad network for their app.
In summary, participants either looked for information in online forums or acted on preconceived notions of what ad networks exist.
This would lead them to a couple of ad networks, for which they would examine the ad network's website, and use it if it looked trustworthy.
They typically kept using an ad network until it presented severe problems.
Prior work suggests that developers often rely on friends and colleagues in tool selection [39,60].
Our survey provided a different picture.
Although 32% of survey participants rated friends as very/extremely important when choosing an ad network, the ad network's website (58%) and online discussion forums (45%) were rated as more important (see Figure 2).
The interviews revealed a more nuanced selection process.
8 interviewees reported choosing a particular ad network based on a vague awareness that other developers were using it with good experiences.
P4 said: "[What ad network to use] wasn't really a thing that we researched too heavily.
It was more when we decided to kind of go that route, you're already kinda familiar with other people doing it; they seemed to have success with it, it didn't seem too difficult to add in."
For others, their ad network choice was based on what they had read in online forums, a vague awareness that a company existed, or even convenience (e.g., the ad network was supported by the SDK they were using to develop the app).
5 interviewees used rough heuristics to select an ad network.
For example, 3 chose Google AdMob due to trust in its reliability, given that it is a large company.
P5 chose AdMob because they believed it would work better on Android, given that Google develops Android.
He said: "Basically because it's Android, and as a Google product it seemed like the natural choice at the time because I trust them more.
So I was like, 'Alright, I'll go with that.'
And I've heard a lot about them so it made most sense."
6 interviewees reported they would then visit an ad network's website, and use the ad network if it looked trustworthy.
Only 2 interviewees reported a conscious effort to compare and contrast different ad networks before choosing one.
Once they chose an ad network, most participants reported sticking with it.
Only 20% (10) of survey participants had switched ad networks.
"Competitor offering more revenue" was the most popular factor in this decision (3 rated 'very important;' 7 'extremely important').
Most interview participants (7) also stuck with their choice despite minor issues (e.g., low revenue), unless it posed severe problems or became unusable.
Those who used ads in multiple apps typically used the same ad network for all apps, due to familiarity with the service and having all their revenue in one place.
Among the 10 interviewees, P3 and P6, who both worked for larger companies with 20 or more employees, displayed unique patterns in ad networks selection.
P3 was instructed by his company to use Google AdMob.
Although he had no definite knowledge as to why Google AdMob was chosen, he Figure 3: Survey answers to "In choosing an advertising partner / advertising network for APP NAME, what factors were considered, and how important were they in making the final decision?"
hypothesized that it was because past apps had used AdMob and the company had experience with it.P6, as CEO of his company, would frequently switch ad networks so as to optimize revenue.
In his words: "What we would actually do is do an A/B test.
[...] We would just write a particular logic method where when you first download an app [...] There would be two different [ad] networks integrated into the application, and randomly you would be assigned to one of them.
We would get all the quantitative data.
How often the ad shows, how often it fills, was it clicked?
Was it annoying?
Did the person delete it?
What was the overall experience?
What's the actual monetary vCPM [viewable cost-per-thousand impressions]?"
Yet, P6 noted that there were overall few changes in the set of 4-5 ad networks used, with AdMob being used the most.
63% (31) of survey participants reported having been involved in ad network selection.
Participants considered different factors in that decision (see Figure 3): 90% of participants considered the security of their users a very/extremely important factor.
Similarly, 74% considered user satisfaction as very/extremely important.
By contrast, revenue or ease of integration were valued less highly (58% and 61%, respectively).
Least important were ad customization options.However, revenue was the most popular decision factor for switching ad networks.
20% (10) of survey participants switched ad networks for an app, and for all revenue was a very/extremely important reason for switching.
For half of them, revenue had been an equally important factor in their initial ad network choice.
For the other half, revenue was more important in switching ad networks than initial selection.The survey findings contrasted with the interview findings: 7 interviewees valued ease of integration the most, even if the ad network may have other shortcomings, such as revenue.
P1 noted: "[StartApp]'s definitely not the best, but it's just an ease to implement."
Considering that most interviewees were independent app developers, they might lack the resources to deal with complicated code, similar to previous findings that developers might lack the time to navigate complex privacy policies [8].
As P1 says "I just don't have enough free time and I'd rather work on my app."
We note that for the interviewees who also took the survey, there were slight disparities between survey and interview responses in this respect.
2 participants who in the interview claimed that ease of integration was most important did not rate ease of integration as very/extremely important in the survey.
Moreover, all who rated ease of integration as very/extremely important in the survey also rated at least one other factor (e.g., revenue) as extremely important in the survey, suggesting that ease of integration was on par with other factors.The contrasting findings from the survey (where user satisfaction was valued highly in ad network choice, and revenue when switching) and the interviews (where ease of integration was valued highly in ad network choice) might be explained by social desirability bias.
However, there were subtle indications in the interviews that the expressed care towards users is genuine, such as "I don't want the app to be unfair to users" (P7), or "I felt better about not being intrusive to users" (P5).
Cognitive dissonance seems a more likely explanation: app developers want an ad network that does not harm their users, but integration and revenue take priority in practice, as they are factors directly experienced by the developers.
Despite claims of valuing certain factors over others, most interviewees (8) used ad networks' default ad settings and code options, regardless of the financial incentives.
For instance, when using an ad network, developers can increase the amount of user data collected by the ad network by asking for additional mobile permissions, which in theory improves the relevance of ads shown to the user, and thus might enhance engagement and revenue.
In contrast to past work finding that developers may add additional permissions for profit reasons [46], 9 interview participants claimed they used an ad network's default permissions or the bare minimum (only P9 added more permissions than necessary).
When asked if they used targeted or non-targeted advertising, 9 interviewees said they used targeted ads (the default), and 4 had not explored the possibility of non-targeted ads.
The main reasons for using targeted ads were not only revenue increase (4), but also to provide a more enjoyable user experience (4), since users are not bothered by irrelevant ads.
P7 said: "I think [targeted ads are] more useful: for the developers, you end up making more money from them; and for the users seeing the ads, it's definitely more useful information.
"Moreover, most ad networks allow developers to customize what ad categories are shown in an app -by default all categories are enabled by most ad networks.
8 interviewees had Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security 231 not changed the defaults; the other 2 restricted certain ad categories for apps aimed at children, or blocked a specific advertiser after a bad experience with them.
While developers explain configuration decisions with optimizing revenue or user experience, their configurations are often not consistent with the stated goals.
For example, most interviewees rationalized targeted ads with improved revenue and user experience, yet they did not ask for additional permissions, which could further increase the accuracy of ad targeting (as well as increase privacy risks).
Thus, rather than engaging in fully rational optimization, developers seem to be subject to status quo bias [62], even despite financial incentives to make adjustments.
One interesting way developers rationalized their ad network configuration was to imagine themselves as the users.
4 interviewees would project themselves onto their users to decide what settings to use, using a logic of 'I don't like it when an app does X, so I will not do X to my users.'
P5, in explaining why he chose to use banner ads, said "I hate the ones that pop up and make you watch a video for thirty seconds because that breaks the flow of your app.
I don't want them to interrupt, I just want to have extra content so banners made the most sense."
Similarly, P2 explained why he used a minimalistic banner ad in his app: "If [users] don't want to, they can avoid it, and I think that's what is important to me personally as a player."
This again suggests that developers cared for and desired a good experience for their users.
This care, though, is nuanced, in that it might have a financial aspect to it: an app that is harmful towards its users may lead to a decline in use.
Thus, care is also important so as to maximize revenue.
We asked survey participants to rate how true or false certain statements were, in order to assess their awareness of consumer risks posed by ad networks (see Figure 4).
Overall, survey participants had mixed awareness of risks associated with ad networks.
Ad networks have been found to sometimes collect user data without explicit consent [22].
When asked whether ad networks collect user data without users' permission, 41% of survey participants considered it probably/definitely true, but 20% false.
Responses are skewed towards 'false' for ad networks' showing malicious ads (17 probably/definitely false; 5 probably/definitely true) or explicit and graphic ads (21 probably/definitely false; 10 probably/definitely true).
Interviewees, on the other hand, were generally aware of ad networks' consumer risks, including malicious or graphic ads, privacy and data collection concerns, and excessive resource draining (battery and data).
Both survey and interview participants expressed mixed opinions about whether certain consumer risks were concerning.
For instance, when asked if they were concerned about ad networks' data collection practices, 23 survey participants said definitely/probably true; 11 said definitely/probably false.Interviewees' responses on what constitutes main consumer risks varied substantially.
When asked what risks they were aware of broadly, 4 mentioned privacy concerns; P5 highlighted how ads used a lot of battery.
We then probed interview participants about four specific types of risks: excessive data collection and tracking; graphic and inappropriate ads; malicious ads; and excessive resource draining.
All interviewees claimed to have heard of these risks, but they had different opinions about how much they mattered.
6 interviewees described excessive resource draining as a minor risk, whereas the other four said it deserved attention, and one of them further described steps they had taken to mitigate this issue.
Similarly, privacy was a big concern for some (4), but for the rest, such as P10, it was a minor issue: "I don't view [privacy] as so much of a problem because it's not just the ad networks gathering it, it's almost all the major vendors and smartphones do that anyway to optimize their own services, so I think it's gonna happen either way."
Despite acknowledging issues with ad networks, both survey and interview participants generally had a positive impression of them.
33% (16) of survey participants said it was probably/definitely true that ad networks had a positive impact on the mobile app ecosystem, as opposed to only 7 for proba-bly/definitely false.
Similarly, half (25) of survey participants said it was probably/definitely true that ad networks provide valuable sources of income for app developers.
Interviewees were also generally favorable toward ad networks, commenting on how they help "monetize an app that's not necessarily monetizable" (P10), and on the ease and convenience they offer developers.
Most survey and interview participants considered it the ad network's responsibility to manage and address consumer risks.
They did not view themselves as having the agency to effect change in this regard.
Both survey and interview participants considered the ad networks responsible for managing and mitigating advertisingrelated consumer risks.
Almost half (22) of survey participants said the ad network should be 'completely responsible' for removing bad ads found on ad networks; whereas only 2 survey participants considered app developers responsible, and 4 pointed at government regulatory entities.
Similarly, all interviewees thought the ad network should be mostly, if not exclusively, responsible for addressing such problems, given the lack of control app developers have over what ads are shown in their apps.Additionally, interviewees expressed resignation toward these risks and that app developers could do little to address them.
When asked about issues with ad networks collecting excessive data, P10 talked about his inability to do anything about it: "There is not much else I can do about it except not use the advertising service, but that's not really a solution.
I don't even know what I could do to counter it."
Some interview participants further expressed an inherent trust in ad networks, in that these companies had the tools, willpower, and capability to filter out 'bad' ads, and thus there was little to worry on behalf of the app developers.
We asked interviewees whether they monitored the ads in their apps.
P3 and P6's companies checked their apps frequently, by having dedicated employees or even a team systematically use the app to ensure the ads that appear are not malicious or explicit.
However, most interviewees (8) did not make much effort to check if the ads in their apps were problematic.
3 explicitly stated that they did not monitor the ads in their app.
For the 5 who did monitor the ads in their apps, they did so in a fairly informal way, such as using the app on a friend's device and seeing what ads appeared.
This was similar to how P3 and P6 monitored their apps, but done in a much less frequent, structured and systematic manner.3 interviewees explained this lack of monitoring with a fear of getting banned from an ad network.
Most ad networks have measures in place to prevent automated or falsified clicks, i.e., 'clickfraud.'
App developers found engaging in clickfraud may face penalties.
Therefore, it is difficult for developers to check the ads in their apps without risking being reprimanded.
P5 explained: "I haven't personally [monitored my ads] because there are really strict rules, with AdMob, about triggering your own ads, because if you do that then it's kind of like trying to make your own money which is a problem.
"2 interviewees pointed out that it would be difficult to monitor malicious ads appearing in an app, given that ad selection is targeted to individual users.
When talking about the possibility of viewers being exposed to overly graphic or explicit ads, P2 said "If a person is targeted with ads that are more graphic in nature, the user would like it because [...] it's based on their viewing history."
This demonstrates strong trust in the accuracy of ad targeting and a disregard for the possibility of misuse or algorithmic bias.
Our findings provide insights on (1) how developers choose ad networks, (2) how developers use and configure ad networks, and (3) how developers manage consumer risks posed by ad networks.
When choosing an ad network, most participants feel resigned to the use of ads, viewing it as the only viable way to monetize an app.
When configuring ad network settings, most participants used default settings regardless of the financial advantages or disadvantages of that choice.
With respect to managing the consumer risks posed by ads, app developers are generally aware of the risks, but consider ad networks responsible for addressing them.We first discuss limitations of our study, followed by opportunities for future research and intervention design that can better support developers in choosing and using ad networks, in ways that monetize their apps while mitigate consumer risks.
Our study's sample consisted largely of developers working independently or for small companies (< 5 employees).
This population constitutes an important faction of the app development ecosystem.
For example, in France and Germany over 30% of app development companies had fewer than 5 employees, and in the UK, it is above 50% [76].
The differences in our interviews between small independent developers and one developer working for a larger company indicate that our findings are likely specific to small independent developers.
Differences in ad network use between small and large app development companies should be studied in more detail in future research.
Studying developers for small apps alone still provides a useful perspective though, given that most apps in Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security 233 the market come from relatively new developers, and we need insight into the perspectives on ad-based monetization (and monetization more generally) from these individuals who just entered the field.
Research with computer science students could also provide valuable insights in this regard.
Due to the specificity of our target population (app developers who had experience working with ad networks), our sample size is seemingly small (49 survey participants, 10 interviewees).
However, our sample size is comparable to other studies examining software developer behaviors [9,11,16,29,30], due to general difficulties in recruiting participants who are professionals.
Our study still provides rich insights into how small independent app developers manage ad networks and reason about associated consumer risks.A common limitation in survey and interview studies relates to how participants may self-report behavior.
Participants may not remember all details accurately, or may try to present a better self-image due to social desirability bias.
We designed our survey and interview protocols in ways that avoid biasing participants.
We also discussed potential indicators of social desirability bias in our findings.
Our findings suggest that many small app developers use ad networks out of resignation that advertising is the only way to make money from their app.
Meanwhile, many participants complained that ad revenue was often low.
It is questionable whether this resignation is well-founded: there are apps that exist without ads, and there seems to be little evidence to suggest that advertising is the only or most profitable way to monetize an app.
Factors such as app category or what platform the app is on can influence how successful different monetization models are [7,37,61].
For instance, Roma et al. find that in Apple's App Store, paid and freemium monetization models generated higher revenues than free models, but they did not find significant differences between monetization models in the Google Play store [61].
Vratonjic et al. suggest that instead of adopting a blanket monetization approach, companies should strategically apply different funding approaches for individual users to maximize profits (e.g., using models to predict different users needs and wants, and serving ad-financed or fee-financed apps to different users) [77].
Given that our participants displayed limited knowledge of monetization models, we suggest a possible intervention: presenting developers with more accurate information about what monetization models are available and optimal for an app under what circumstances, as well as associated risks or benefits for consumers.
This could increase developers' awareness of potential monetization models beyond the dominant reliance on advertising, and could encourage developers to adopt monetization models that increase revenue and pose fewer risks to consumers.To accomplish this, more research is needed to (1) characterize and understand what monetization models are optimal for mobile apps under what circumstances; (2) analyze the impact of different monetization models on consumers, e.g., risks associated with each model and how consumers perceive them; and ambitiously, (3) explore new monetization models for apps that go beyond advertising and paid models, which ideally retain the low barrier to entry that free apps have, but do not pose the same consumer risks as targeted advertising.One alternative way to finance apps is through crowdfunding, which has been an effective way to raise funds for projects related to games and journalism [4,47].
This funding model could change the dynamic between app developer and consumer, creating a closer relationship and encouraging developers to act more responsibly towards their consumers [4,13].
Another option for monetizing apps could lie in virtual currencies.
For example, the social media platform Steemit rewards users who generate appreciated content with its own cryptocurrency: user accounts on Steemit are able to upvote posts and comments, and authors who get upvoted are rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens [18,48].
Other platforms that adopt similar blockchain-based monetization models include Brave, SoMee.Social, Minds.com, and Presearch.org [2].
Moreover, certain subscription services (such as Youtube Premium) [31] work by having users pay a monthly flat fee, which gives users access to all content on their platform: the total money from these fees is distributed to the creators based on how much users interact with them (more interaction = larger share of the total money).
Applying this to the context of mobile apps, one can imagine apps being monetized and valued based on the amount of downloads or users they have.Once it is better understood which monetization models work best under what circumstances, as well as their respective benefits and disadvantages for both developers and consumers, a system (e.g. a website) could be constructed to aid developers with choosing a suitable monetization model for their app: after developers enter the characteristics of the app, such as the app's category and expected audience, the system would then recommend monetization models and show comparisons along multiple dimensions (e.g., revenue, user signup/conversion rate, public perception, and consumer risks).
This system could be a standalone website or be offered by mobile platforms as part of their developer resources.
It could also be integrated into online app development tutorials and courses (e.g., as a module on "financing your app"), as well as into integrated development environments (IDEs).
We argue that aiding developers with information grounded in research and data, as opposed to intuition or heuristics, could benefit both developers and consumers by highlighting less well-known monetization models with fewer consumer risks than advertising.
The potential for success of this approach is supported by our finding that developers already engage in a deliberation process regarding their app's monetization model, but often in an unstructured manner.
This indicates that developers may be amenable to and benefit from more systematic information on monetization models.
Participants in our study exhibited status quo bias [62]: they tended to stick to ad networks' default settings, regardless of the financial incentives involved.
This implies that if harmful content appears in an app (e.g., sensitive products are being advertised), this is more likely due to the ad network's default setting, rather than any initiative by the developer.
However, previous research has found that app developers sometimes ask for more permissions than necessary in their apps for financial reasons [46].
We thus propose that one way to limit consumer risks posed by ad networks could be encouraging or mandating ad networks to change what the default settings are.
This approach has been used successfully in other contexts, such as healthy meal selection [41].
In the context of in-app advertising, the specific default settings to be regulated could relate to what permissions are set, whether targeted (or nontargeted) ads are used by default, and what categories of ads are permissible.For instance, the default permissions required by an ad network could be reduced to the minimum necessary for the ad network to function.
This would limit what data about consumers is collected and used for advertising purposes, and would also correspond to the GDPR's "data protection by default" principle.
Additionally, in order to address privacy concerns of targeted advertising [80], the default could be set to 'non-targeted' rather than 'targeted' ads.
Alternatively, it could be mandated that apps have to ask users for explicit consent to engage in targeted advertising (and if a user does not consent, show non-targeted ads).
Consequently, fewer apps may engage in targeted advertising, perhaps alleviating some of the associated concerns.
Moreover, currently it is common practice for most or all ad categories to be enabled by default.
This should be changed so that certain sensitive ads, such as those for harmful products like tobacco or alcohol, political ads, or predatory ads (e.g., 'Get Rich Quick' ads that prey on vulnerable populations), are blocked by default.
This could reduce the instances of such ads appearing and causing negative consequences, such as discomfort for consumers [3], the manipulation of people's voting behavior [42], and the sale of respective harmful products.Of course, ad networks may be resistant to our proposed changes.
There are financial incentives for maintaining the current defaults.
Targeted ads may increase profit for the ad network, and greater data tracking may allow better (and so more profitable) targeted advertising [10].
Aside from the profitability of the ads themselves, more data might also hold better value for sale to third parties, such as data brokers.
It is unlikely that ad networks will simply change their behavior due to these competing incentives, especially given that the advertising industry is mostly self-regulated through entities like the Digital Advertising Alliance.We suggest regulators need to hold ad networks accountable by prescribing how defaults should be set up when selfregulatory approaches are ineffective.
Consumer concerns about privacy risks are high [21], indicating that there may be political will to enact legislation.
For instance, a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommended that U.S. Congress should enact legislation to better protect consumers [19].
Other legislative efforts to regulate data tracking, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), have already been ratified and are being implemented.
It is conceivable that future privacy legislation, such as the European ePrivacy Regulation or possibly a U.S. federal consumer privacy law, could stipulate more consumerfriendly default practices by ad networks.App developers could also potentially drive ad networks to change defaults.
App developers may desire to protect users, as directly suggested by our findings.
Therefore, a collective call from app developers may exert pressure on ad networks.
For instance, app developers could advocate that current app store requirements should be modified to avoid harmful content and prevent excessive data collection by default.Finally, we should not neglect the possibility that ad networks may display goodwill.
Faced with increasing concern and scrutiny surrounding data tracking practices, ad networks might want to regain consumer trust.
Ad networks could set defaults that safeguard consumers to portray themselves as taking consumer safety and privacy seriously, while also providing a more explicit value proposition of targeted ads to consumers.
Our findings indicate that developers care about the wellbeing of their users, e.g., most of our survey participants ranked app user security and satisfaction as very/extremely important in choosing an ad network.
This aligns with Balebako et al.'s findings, suggesting developers want to create secure code that respects user privacy, but fail to do so for a variety of reasons such as struggling with complex privacy policies [8].
Our results reveal two main reasons why developers fail to mitigate ad-related consumer risks: (1) a belief that even though problems exist with ad networks, there is nothing app developers can do; and (2) a resignation that advertising is the only way to monetize an app.Given this, we propose two opportunities for intervention.
The first is to correct the belief that developers cannot effect change.
At first glance, app developers may seem small when compared to ad networks, but they are still a crucial part of the advertising ecosystem.
As such, they can effect change: both by simple actions such as configuring ads in certain ways (e.g., blocking ads for sensitive products), or more involved actions such as voicing complaints and concerns over ad network practices, or boycotting certain ad networks.
Second and more importantly, as a prerequisite of encouraging action, it is important to make app developers realize that safeguarding app users from ad-related risks is not only the responsibility of ad networks, but also theirs.To encourage developers to take on responsibility, the focus of responsibility should be switched from blaming to collective action.
Usually responsibility is talked about in terms of blame -if someone is responsible for consumer safety and the consumer is harmed, then that entity is blamed.
Interpreting responsibility this way might be counter-productive, since it could alienate developers by painting them as 'guilty culprits.'
Additionally, this interpretation does not show an accurate picture of the realities of in-app advertising.
Loui and Miller discuss moral responsibility (as opposed to legal or causal responsibility) as a form of responsibility that, rather than seeking one actor or entity to blame for a system's problems, encourages all responsible actors to think critically about their role in the problem, and what they could do to mitigate the problem [49].
Similarly, Gotterbarn brings up 'positive responsibility,' a concept that does not seek to hold one party accountable or to blame for a system's problems, but rather motivates developers to think about the consequences of their actions on others [33].
Applying the positive responsibility framing to the context of in-app advertising, developers should not be blamed for the consumer risks of advertising.
Rather, it emphasizes that in-app advertising is an ecosystem with multiple actors and stakeholders (advertisers, ad networks, app developers, and consumers).
All members of the ecosystem do their part in allowing it to work, for good and for bad.
The actions of those within the ecosystem influences how it will function -and so, it is on all the system's actors to make in-app advertising work better for everyone.Given that developers seem to generally care about their users, as evidenced by our study and prior work [8], this suggests that developers might be amenable to taking actions that would mitigate consumer risks and protect their users.
To achieve this, we suggest that it is important to show developers the power they have and the actions they can take.
There are many places where this message could be promoted.
One way is to target app development tutorials, courses, and online forums that developers visit frequently: creating new content that discusses positive responsibility and specific actions developers can take to mitigate consumer risks.
This is in line with Mozilla's recent efforts to incorporate ethics into computer science curricula [54].
However, we acknowledge that encouraging developers to take responsibilities for consumer risks can be challenging.
Not all developers would be willing to put in the effort needed to take on positive responsibility.
Some might be in dire financial situations that make it difficult to properly care about their users.
To address these barriers, material incentives should be created to encourage positive responsibilityperhaps a badge, token, or icon awarded to developers who proactively attempt to mitigate consumer risks of ad networks (e.g., a "fair trade" label for ads).
Such a badge could be displayed to consumers as part of app descriptions, and help consumers identify responsibly designed apps.
This would hopefully lead to more consumers using such apps, increasing their revenue, thus serving as an incentive for developers to earn this certification.Even with these incentives, there are still challenges that positive responsibility faces.
Further avenues of research could examine what factors could encourage the adoption of positive responsibility in developers, similar to research on encouraging other prosocial behavior (e.g., examining how economic incentives encourage blood donations or how technology can be used to increase empathy [40,44]).
We conducted a mixed-methods study to better understand how and why developers choose and use ad networks, and how they manage consumer risks.
We find that most developers feel resigned to use advertising, seeing it as the only viable way to profit from their apps.
Developers mostly choose an ad network based on factors like which ad networks they perceive to be popular rather than a holistic assessment.
Most developers use ad networks' default configurations regardless of the financial implications of that choice.
Almost all developers believe the responsibility to mitigate the consumer risks of in-app advertising lies with ad networks.We discuss several proposals for better supporting developers in mitigating consumer risks, such as presenting information on alternate monetization models for apps to developers, and enacting policy to make the default configurations of ad networks more consumer-friendly.
Future work is needed to further explore these proposals, including both their effectiveness at overcoming consumer risks posed by in-app advertising, as well as challenges that we may face in getting developers to notice any provided guidance and support.
To learn more in-depth about your experience with in-app advertising, we want to ask you about a specific app you have worked in which you were especially involved with either choosing the advertising partner / advertising network to use, configuring what sort of ads are shown, or integrating the necessary code to display ads in the app.

What is the operating System for that app?
Select all that apply.
(a) Banner ads (rectangular ads that occupy a portion of an app's layout; can be refreshed automatically after a period of time) (b) Interstitial ads (full-page ad format that appears at natural breaks and transitions, such as level completion in a game) (c) Native ads (advertisements presented to users via UI components that are native to the platform: for example, they can match the visual design of the app they are in) (d) Reward ads (Ad format that rewards users for watching ads) (e) Other (please specify) (f) Do not know / Cannot Remember 20.
Who was responsible for choosing the ad formats used in APP?
(a) Android (b) iOS (c) Blackberry (d)(select all that apply): (a) Competitor offered better revenue (e.g., higher eCPM (effective cost per one thousand impressions) rates) (b) Competitor offered more customization options (e.g., more customizability with regards to what ads to place) (c) Competitor offered an overall better product (e.g., offered higher quality ads) (d) Advertising partner / advertising network displayed ads that were harmful to users of the app (e.g., the ads installed malware on user devices).
(e) Advertising partner / advertising network displayed ads that were explicit (e.g., advertisements that showed pornography, ads that showed graphic violence).
Sometimes, when an app uses an advertising network to display ads, an ad can be shown that is either harmful to users (e.g., installs malware on user devices) or otherwise illegal (e.g., displays explicit ads for terrorism or prostitution This research has been partially funded by the University of Michigan School of Information.
