To test whether there is a significant difference in the time to complete these tasks among the three different applications, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test.
We found that there are statistically significant differences among the applications for both finding the ceremony (p = 0.031) and completing the ceremony (p = 0.043).
We next ran pairwise post-hoc Dunn's tests to determine where the differences occur.
We found a significant difference between Facebook Messenger and What-sApp for finding the ceremony (p = 0.030), with Facebook Messenger being faster (mean time, Facebook Messenger=2.5 minutes, WhatsApp=3.7 minutes).
We also found a significant difference between Viber and WhatsApp for completing the ceremony (p = 0.045), with Viber being faster (mean time, Viber=6.9 minutes, WhatsApp=8.5 minutes).

We found a significant difference between Viber and WhatsApp for completing the ceremony (p = 0.045), with Viber being faster (mean time, Viber=6.9 minutes, WhatsApp=8.5 minutes).
We first tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
As Table 8 shows, the data is not normally distributed for any application (p<0.05).
We next ran the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a nonparametric test that can determine if there are statistically significant differences between two or more groups.
This test rejects the null hypothesis that the distribution of task times is hte same across the applications, for both finding the ceremony (p=0.031) and completing the ceremony (p=0.043).
We next ran pairwise post-hoc tests to determine where the differences occur.As Table 9 shows, We found a significant difference between WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger for finding the ceremony (p=0.029), with Facebook Messenger being faster (mean time, WhatsApp=3.7 minutes, Facebook Messenger=2.5 minutes).
We also found a significant difference between Viber and WhatsApp for completing the ceremony (p=0.021), with Viber being faster (mean time WhatsApp=8.5 minutes, Viber 6.7 minutes).
Note, the significance has been adjusted by the Bonferonni correction for multiple tests.

We next ran the Kruskal-Wallis test, which is a nonparametric test that can determine if there are statistically significant differences between two or more groups.
This test retains the null hypothesis that the distribution of task times is the same across the applications for finding the ceremony (p=0.278), but rejects the null hypothesis for completing the ceremony (p=0.043).
We next ran pairwise post-hoc tests to determine where the differences occur for completing the ceremony.As Table 9 shows, we found a significant difference between Viber and WhatsApp for completing the ceremony (p=0.045), with Viber being faster (mean time WhatsApp=8.5 minutes, Viber 6.7 minutes).
